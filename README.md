# Project name: happy-tree-friends
## Tree Algorithm
- Implement a tree algorithm to compute gravity in 2D
  - Compare the performance and accuracy with different cell-opening criteria
  - Measure the performance scaling (i.e., wall-clock time vs. number of particles)
- Bonus points
  - You get bonus points automatically since this topic is not covered by our lecture
  - Extend to 3D
  - Orbit integration
  - Periodic boundary condition
