# Project name: happy-tree-friends
## General Guidelines and Requirements
-  Must parallelize your program by at least one of the following methods
    -  OpenMP (minimum requirement)
    -  MPI (get bonus point)
    -  GPU (get extra bonus point)
-  Must provide convincing demonstration of the accuracy and performance of your program
-  Must use GitHub for collaborative development
    -  Tutorial: https://gitbook.tw/
    -  Use the Fork→Pull→Push→Pull Request→Merge workflow
    -  Do NOT just upload the final code → must keep the development history on GitHub
-  Students per group: 2
    -  Inform the TA before April 26
-  Final presentation: June 7
    -  25 mins presentation + 10 mins questions
    -  All students are encouraged to ask ANY questions
-  Bonus points: Surprise Me!!!
## Tree Algorithm
- Implement a tree algorithm to compute gravity in 2D
  - Compare the performance and accuracy with different cell-opening criteria
  - Measure the performance scaling (i.e., wall-clock time vs. number of particles)
- Bonus points
  - You get bonus points automatically since this topic is not covered by our lecture
  - Extend to 3D
  - Orbit integration
  - Periodic boundary condition
